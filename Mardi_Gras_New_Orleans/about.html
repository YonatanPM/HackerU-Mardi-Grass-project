            <h2>History</h2>
            <div>
              <p>
                The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe,
                passing through Rome and Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries
                to the French House of the Bourbons. From here, the traditional
                revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her
                colonies. On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean
                Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a plot of ground
                60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du
                Mardi Gras" when his men realized it was the eve of the festive
                holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la Louisiane"
                (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of
                Fort Louis de la Mobile celebrated America's very first Mardi
                Gras. In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la
                Mobile), similar to those that form our current Mardi Gras
                krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society"
                was formed and paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession
                was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on wheels by 16
                men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in
                white and signaling the coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred
                on Fat Tuesday. New Orleans was established in 1718 by
                Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in New
                Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early
                1740s, Louisiana's governor, the Marquis de Vaudreuil,
                established elegant society balls, which became the model for
                the New Orleans Mardi Gras balls of today. The earliest
                reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to
                the Spanish colonial governing body. That year, the Perseverance
                Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of hundreds of
                clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans. By the
                late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with
                carriages and horseback riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling
                gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the krewe's
                members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and
                festivity. In 1856, six young Mobile natives formed the Mistick
                Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent
                their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New
                Orleans with dazzling floats (known as tableaux cars) and masked
                balls. Krewe members remained anonymous. In 1870, Mardi Gras'
                second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is
              </p>

              <p>
                also the first recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."
                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and
                they even printed "Carnival Edition" lithographs of parades'
                fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes
                and floats were always carefully guarded before the procession).
                At first, these reproductions were small, and details could not
                be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade
                "Visions of Other Worlds," these chromolithographs could be
                produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float
                and costume designs of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and
                B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to life
                by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who
                for 40 years was responsible for creating all of Carnival's
                floats and processional outfits. 1872 was the year that a group
                of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over
                the first daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand
                Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced Romanoff's
                family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official
                colors. Purple stands for justice; gold for power; and green for
                faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's
                improbable anthem, "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due
                in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune. The following year,
                floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead
                of France, culminating with Comus' magnificent "The Missing
                Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic
                paper-mache' animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to
                mock both Darwin's theory and local officials, including
                Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the
                "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a legal holiday in
                Louisiana, which it still is. Like Comus and the Twelfth Night
                Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private
                social clubs with restrictive membership policies. Since all of
                these parade organizations are completely funded by their
                members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on
                Earth!"

            <h2>LaToya Cantrell</h2>
            <div class="d-lg-flex d-sm-block d-md-block flex-nowrap justify-content-between">
              <p>
                Cantrell was inaugurated as mayor on May 7, 2018, the first
                woman to hold the position in the city's history. Once in
                office, she established a new Office of Youth and Families, with
                the goal of creating a strategic plan to address families in
                crisis in the city. Cantrell also founded a Gun Violence
                Reduction Council, tasked with finding solutions to violent
                crime. Starting with a push to rededicate hotel taxes collected
                within the city for city use, Cantrell has focused on her
                #fairshare initiative to improve city infrastructure, public
                transportation, public parks, and green spaces. As part of that
                initiative, in October 2018 the City of New Orleans filed a
                lawsuit against four opioid manufacturers and distributors.
                During the 2019 session of the Louisiana Legislature, Cantrell
                negotiated the Fair Share Agreement with Governor John Bel
                Edwards and city, state, and tourism officials. The agreement
                secured $50 million in upfront funding for the city's
                infrastructure needs as well as $26 million in annual recurring
                revenue for the city. Following the approval of the Fair Share
                Agreement, New Orleans voters approved 3 of the 4 proposals
                Mayor Cantrell and the City Council put on the ballot in the
                2019 general election. Voters approved a $500 million bond sale
                and a tax on short-term rental properties, as well the
                establishment of a Human Right Commission under the New Orleans
                Home Rule Charter.
